# What's this then?

It's just a practice exercise designed to familiarise with how JavaScript can interact with HTML and CSS via various built-in methods. There isn't a whole bunch going on here.

# What can I do with it?

Not much! If you want to mess around with it, one way you could do so is to install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and its [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension, then use them to open the contents of this repository in a browser of your choice. It isn't very exciting, though.

There's no licence here, because it's not really anything worth licencing. Just don't blame me if you somehow break your computer and we'll be awright.
